# Trending box Office Movies Study

#### This study was done by Linus Gichuhi

### Introduction
A Box office is simply a movie theater, where tickets can be purchased or reserved.When people discuss the box office sucess, they are talking to how successful a movie or play is in terms of how many people go see it or how much money it makes.A captivating plot, a well-written script, excellent actors who can connect with the audience, a visionary director working with a director of photography and editor, and so on are just a few of the common elements that make a movie a box office success.

Whenever movies gross a lot of profit and income ,they attract a lot of investors..The bigger the audience the bigger the profit the movie makes.An investor must consider additional revenue sources while keeping in mind historical box office trends.For instance certain actors can be trusted to provide good money at the box office when they have provided 2-3 hit movies.However, given that audience tastes and preferences have changed, a celebrity alone is no longer sufficient.

Sometimes a movie's marketing costs will match or even exceed its actual production costs. These days, a movie's fate may be determined by its marketing, or it may dangle in the balance while going ignored among hundreds of other comparable movies. A great marketing strategy can change everything. Given the increased rivalry in the film industry, it is critical for an investor to do their homework on production companies, get to know their owners, and be passionate about movies in general. It is better to know more.

Investors are increasingly turning to quantitative analysis and machine learning approaches to not only forecast audience tastes but also their preferences due to the development of technology and the accessibility of enormous amounts of  data. Using a variety of market-specific characteristics, including movie ratings, reviews, and budget, I hope to create conclusions on the kind of movies that are performing the best at the box office in this research. The project's findings may offer insightful information about tastes and preferences of the audience, enabling investors to make well-informed investment decisions.
