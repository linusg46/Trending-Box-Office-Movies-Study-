# Trending box Office Movies Study

#### This study was done by Linus Gichuhi

### Introduction
A Box office is simply a movie theater, where tickets can be purchased or reserved.When people discuss the box office sucess, they are talking to how successful a movie or play is in terms of how many people go see it or how much money it makes.A captivating plot, a well-written script, excellent actors who can connect with the audience, a visionary director working with a director of photography and editor, and so on are just a few of the common elements that make a movie a box office success.

Whenever movies gross a lot of profit and income ,they attract a lot of investors..The bigger the audience the bigger the profit the movie makes.An investor must consider additional revenue sources while keeping in mind historical box office trends.For instance certain actors can be trusted to provide good money at the box office when they have provided 2-3 hit movies.However, given that audience tastes and preferences have changed, a celebrity alone is no longer sufficient.

Sometimes a movie's marketing costs will match or even exceed its actual production costs. These days, a movie's fate may be determined by its marketing, or it may dangle in the balance while going ignored among hundreds of other comparable movies. A great marketing strategy can change everything. Given the increased rivalry in the film industry, it is critical for an investor to do their homework on production companies, get to know their owners, and be passionate about movies in general. It is better to know more.

Investors are increasingly turning to quantitative analysis and machine learning approaches to not only forecast audience tastes but also their preferences due to the development of technology and the accessibility of enormous amounts of  data. Using a variety of market-specific characteristics, including movie ratings, reviews, and budget, I hope to create conclusions on the kind of movies that are performing the best at the box office in this research. The project's findings may offer insightful information about tastes and preferences of the audience, enabling investors to make well-informed investment decisions.

### Data Understanding
The IMDB dataset files can be accessed and downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com/. The data is free and refreshed daily.Various sources, including directors, film studios, on-screen credits, and other official sources, provide information for IMDb. But a lot of the data originates from IMDb users, who can add information in wiki-style format.
I used a total of 4 datasets from the imdb datasets which are as follows:
  1.The movie dataset has 26517 rows and a total of 10 columns.It contains the films general information like original title and the films       ID.
  2.The ratings datset has 73856 rows and 3 colums.It simply contains ratings of the films given by the viewers ranging from 0-10.
  3.The budget datset has 5782 rows and 6 colums.It contains the production budget and the gross revenue both domestic and worldwide.
  4.The gross revenue  datset has 3387 rows and 5 colums.It contains the foreign and domestic gross information of the films.
### Methodology

#### Data Wrangling
However, only a few features and rows from the several datasets that were gathered are important to the procedure. Therefore, in this step, features from each dataset that were not necessary were dropped.The remaining datasets were analsyed and cleaned.

### Conclusions
  -A high budget is necessary for a productive and successful film at the box office but that may not be the case when important factors        such film marketing are considered.
  - For a film to perform well worldwide it has to perfom well domesticaly
  - a low production budget does not necessary ,there are cases where the film performs well worldwide and domestically
  - A high rating does not necesserarily mean a film is popular .
 
### Recommedations

  - The company shoild invest on proper Marketing .This can be done for example by having well known actors having the lead roles or cameos     in the films.This increases the popularity attracting a lot of audience in the Cinemas.
  - Use an experienced cast and crew .This will help to  ensure that the actors are contributing to making the director's vision a reality       and a success.
